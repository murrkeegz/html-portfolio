<h1>The Best Movies According to Mary</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies that came out in 2024 (that I actually saw.)</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>Sasquatch Sunset</h3>
    <p>A funny, poignant, wordless domestic drama/survival story about the last of an apocrphyal breed of North American primates.</p>
<h3>Late Night With The Devil</h3>
    <p>A horror period piece with a fresh take on found footage and possession narratives, bonus points for a refreshingly original monster design.</p>
<h3>Small Things Like These</h3>
    <p>Heartbreaking film based on the novel, based on real events in Ireland in the early 90s.  An emotional slow burn with beautiful cinematography.</p>
